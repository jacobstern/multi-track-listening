# Welcome!

Multi-track listening is a new way to experience music. It originated in 2016
with [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2CKKV4Z44A), which
also represents the canonical multi-track listening product. This website was
created to facilitate creation and sharing of mixes in the spirit of the
original work.
